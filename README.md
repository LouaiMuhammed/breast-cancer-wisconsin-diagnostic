# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) - Normality Testing Project

## Overview

This project utilizes the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset to build a machine learning model capable of classifying whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on features derived from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

The goal is to aid early and accurate diagnosis using interpretable features extracted from the tumor cell nuclei present in the image.

## Background

This dataset stems from research by **Dr. William H. Wolberg** who aimed to diagnose breast cancer using only data obtained from FNAs. He collaborated with the University of Wisconsin to develop a classifier using the **Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T)**, which achieved approximately **97% accuracy** on new instances.

This dataset has since become a benchmark in binary classification and medical diagnosis research.

## Dataset Summary

- **Total Instances**: 569
- **Target Classes**: 
  - `Malignant` (cancerous)
  - `Benign` (non-cancerous)
- **Features**: 30 numeric features derived from:
  - 10 base features:
    - `radius`
    - `texture`
    - `perimeter`
    - `area`
    - `smoothness`
    - `compactness`
    - `concavity`
    - `concave points`
    - `symmetry`
    - `fractal dimension`
  - Each base feature has three measurements:
    - **Mean**
    - **Standard Error (SE)**
    - **Worst (largest value)**

## Statistical Assumptions & Normality Testing

As part of the preprocessing and exploratory phase, we assessed the **normality** of the features using a combination of visual and statistical methods:

### Techniques Used:
- **QQ Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)**  
  Visual tool to assess if a feature's distribution deviates from a normal distribution.

- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**  
  Suitable for small to moderate sample sizes; tests the null hypothesis that data was drawn from a normal distribution.

- **Anderson-Darling Test**  
  A robust test that returns critical values for several significance levels; helps evaluate how far data diverges from normality.

- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test**  
  Non-parametric test comparing the sample distribution with a reference (normal) distribution.

### Key Observations:
- Many of the features showed deviations from normality, especially skewness in size-related features (e.g., `area`, `radius`, `perimeter`).
- Normality tests informed decisions around data transformations, scaling, and the choice of machine learning models (parametric vs non-parametric).
